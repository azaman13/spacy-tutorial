We had a death pact, and I have to keep my half of the bargain. Please bury me next to my baby. Bury me in my leather jacket, jeans and motorcycle boots Goodbye.
Dear World, I am leaving because I am bored. I feel I have lived long enough. I am leaving you with your worries in this sweet cesspool. Good luck.
Dearest, I feel certain that I am going mad again. I feel we can’t go through another of those terrible times. And I shan’t recover this time…. Everything has gone from me but the certainty of your goodness. I can’t go on spoiling your life any longer.
I don’t have the passion anymore, and so remember, it’s better to burn out than to fade away.
I am haunted by the vivid memories of killings and corpses and anger and pain … of starving or wounded children, of trigger-happy madmen, often police, of killer executioners.
To my friends, my work is done- Why wait?
I am going to put myself to sleep now for a bit longer than usual. Call it Eternity.
I'm so sorry—love, Elliott. God forgive me.
All fled-all done, so lift me on the pyre; The feast is over, and the lambs expire.
I must end it. There's no hope left. I'll be at peace. No one had anything to do with this. My decision totally.
I am afraid, I am a coward. I am sorry for everything. If I had done this a long time ago, it would have saved a lot of pain.
Life has become unbearable for me. Forgive me.
Dear World, I am leaving because I am bored. I feel I have lived long enough. I am leaving you with your worries in this sweet cesspool. Good luck.
